Module 2: What is JavaScript?

After having worked through all lectures in DWA_02: What is JavaScript, the following questions were raised:
1. What do ES5, ES6 and ES2015 mean - and what are the differences between them?
2. What are JScript, ActionScript and ECMAScript - and how do they relate to JavaScript?
3. What is an example of a JavaScript specification - and where can you find it?
4. What are v8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra and Tamarin? Do they run JavaScript differently?
5. Show a practical example using caniuse.com and the MDN compatibility table.
